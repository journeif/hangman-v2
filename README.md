## ⚙️ How the Game Works

1. **HangmanGame Component**: This is the main component where the game is played. It handles the game logic (starting new games, tracking guesses, and displaying the game state).
2. **Server Integration**: The backend server (`server.js`) keeps track of user wins and losses. It communicates with the frontend to store and retrieve stats.
3. **Game Over**: If the player runs out of life (6 incorrect guesses), they lose the game, and the word is revealed. If they guess the word correctly, they win.
4. **State Management**: React hooks manage game state, including the word to guess, remaining life, used letters, and game results.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Implement multiplayer mode.
- Add more words to the word bank for a varied game experience.
- Track user scores persistently via a database (e.g., MongoDB).
